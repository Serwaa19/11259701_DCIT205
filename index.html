          <p>"My experience at Computer Science Department has been academically rewarding. As a student enrolled in the Computer Science specialization, I have had the opportunity to learn the latest technical skills, such as development for mobile devices and interactive web-based applications. The small class sizes enable students to closely interact with instructors. Professors at University of Ghana,Legon, offer enriching research positions to students, which has personally led me to pursue Graduate Studies."
